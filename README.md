### Starting the Game

### How to play 
Player will click two boxes and two Pictures will be revealed, 
To win the game player has to find all the pairs.

The object of the game is to turn over all pairs of matching pictures. 

### Notes
I picked the memory game project because it sounded simple for the first project, turns out not as simple as I thought.
In the making I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The game can be improved by adding pictured to the ‘img’ folder and creating other rounds of the game.
